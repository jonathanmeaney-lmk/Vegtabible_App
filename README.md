**The recipe bible for vegetarians and "part-time" veggies.**

Vegtabible is digital cookbook app which allows users to upload and share recipes with the Vegtabible community and search all the recipes that have been uploaded by other users. 

The website is aimed at vegetarians but more particularly at the growing number of “part-time” vegetarians – people who are making an effort to eat vegetarian meals a couple of times per week be it for environmental or health reasons, or maybe simply just because they like to. 

The problem for many “part-time” veggies is that they’re repertoire of tasty veggie meals is generally quite limited, in comparison to full-time vegetarians. Vegtabible, therefore, is a platform that allows them to discover new vegetarian meals, as well as upload and share their own discoveries with the community. 

From handwritten notes, printed-out sheets and cookbooks, to recipes bookmarked on our web browsers, screenshots on our phones, or Whatsapp messages, one major issue many homecooks have is that their recipes saved and scattered all over the place. It can be hard find, let alone, remember them all. Vegtabible allows users to store all of their favorite veggie recipes in one place, while also discovering new ones.

    - Orange is used for the search button on the homepage and also for user alert messages. 

    - Red, greens and blues have been used for buttons throughout the page.
